  "A handy guide to grasp the moon's timing on this special day, honored Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon, eagerly awaited on Karwa Chauth, typically rises late in the evening. This isn't mere chance but stems from the moon's graceful cosmic rhythm, its orbital path, and our earthly vantage point.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it's just four days after the full moon, the moonrise happens later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, and by day four of the waning phase, this delay becomes notable, making moonrise much later than it was on the full moon night.",
  "The exact time the moon rises depends on your latitude and longitude, which is why it varies between different locations on Earth.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi timings are included for your ease.",
  "This diagram shows the moon rising later each night after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth evening, aligns with a phase when the moon emerges late.",
  "The moon's arrival signifies more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the devotion woven into marital ties. This waiting period forms the soul of the festival, ending poignantly as the fast concludes with the moon's ascent."
