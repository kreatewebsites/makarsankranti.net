  "A hands-on guide to grasping the moon's schedule on this special day, marked for October 20, 2024.",
  "The long-awaited moon on Karwa Chauth typically graces the sky later in the evening. This timing aligns with a stunning cosmic rhythm, dictated by the moon's orbital path, its position overhead, and Earth's location.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Just days after the full moon, it rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, and by the fourth day of waning, this delay shifts moonrise well beyond the timing on the full moon night.",
  "Your exact position on Earth—latitude and longitude—sets the precise time the moon rises, causing variations between cities.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Sunday, October 20, 2024. Details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi timings are also included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each night after the full moon. By the fourth day, during Karwa Chauth, the moon naturally appears much later in the evening.",
  "The moon’s arrival is more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the devotion at marriage's core. This wait transforms into the festival's soul, ending with the fast’s heartfelt conclusion under the moonlit sky."
