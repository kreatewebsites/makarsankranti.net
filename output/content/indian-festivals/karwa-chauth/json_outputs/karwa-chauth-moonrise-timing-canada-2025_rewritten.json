  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special day, honored on Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon on Karwa Chauth is often eagerly awaited as it rises late in the evening. This isn't by chance but stems from the moon's graceful cosmic rhythm, shaped by its orbit, position, and Earth's location.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it's just four days after the full moon, the moon rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth waning night, its rise is much delayed compared to the full moon.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—determined by latitude and longitude—sets the precise moment the moon rises. This explains why times vary between locations.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi timing are included for your reference.",
  "This chart shows the moon's rising time delays nightly after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, happens when the moon naturally rises late in the cycle.",
  "The moon's arrival signifies more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the unwavering devotion of marriage. This waiting period transforms into the festival's emotional core, ending in the poignant act of breaking the fast."
