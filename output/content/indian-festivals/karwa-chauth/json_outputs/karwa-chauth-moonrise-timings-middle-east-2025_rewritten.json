  "A hands-on guide to grasping the moon's schedule on this special Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon, eagerly awaited on Karwa Chauth, usually rises late in the evening. This isn't by chance; it's tied to the cosmic dance of nature. The delay stems from the moon's orbit, its celestial position, and our Earth's vantage point.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Just days after the full moon, it rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth day of waning, moonrise shifts much later compared to the full moon night.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—latitude and longitude—sets when the moon rises, which is why times vary between cities.",
  "Choose your city to view the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi duration are also included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises progressively later each night after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, aligns with a phase when the moon emerges late.",
  "The moon's arrival is more than a ritual; it stands as a poignant emblem of love, patience, sacrifice, and the unwavering devotion within the marital bond. This anticipation forms the festival's essence, reaching its peak as the fast ends under the moonlit sky."
