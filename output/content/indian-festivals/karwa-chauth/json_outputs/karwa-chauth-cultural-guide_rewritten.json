  "Veeravati, the cherished sister of seven brothers, observed her first Karwa Chauth fast while staying at her parents' home. By evening, she grew weak from hunger and thirst. Unable to see her suffer, her brothers devised a trick—they placed a mirror behind a pipal tree to mimic the moon. Believing it was time, she broke her fast. Soon after, devastating news arrived: her husband, a king, had fallen critically ill. On her journey to him, Goddess Parvati appeared and revealed her brothers' deception. The Goddess instructed Veeravati to re-observe the fast with devotion. Veeravati faithfully followed the advice, and Yama, the god of death, had no choice but to restore her husband's life. The tale underscores the significance of faith and dedication in observing the fast.",

Yama, the God of Death, arrived to claim Satyavan's soul, but Savitri, unwavering in her love and devotion, followed him.

For her final boon, she requested to be blessed with children, a wish impossible without her husband. Bound by her clever request, Yama restored Satyavan's life.
