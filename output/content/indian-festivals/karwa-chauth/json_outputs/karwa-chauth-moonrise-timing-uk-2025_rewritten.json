  "A hands-on guide to grasping the moon's schedule on this special Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon on Karwa Chauth, often rising late, follows a mesmerizing cosmic rhythm. This timing aligns with its orbital path, position in the sky, and Earth's location.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the Krishna Paksha, the moon's waning phase. Since it’s just four days after the full moon, the moonrise happens later in the evening.",

  "Your exact spot on Earth—latitude and longitude—sets when the moon rises, causing times to vary between cities.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. You'll also find details on the fasting hours (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi duration for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each night after the full moon, with Karwa Chauth occurring on the fourth day when the moon naturally appears late.",
  "The wait for the moon transcends tradition, embodying patience, love, sacrifice, and the devotion woven into marital ties. This anticipation forms the soul of the festival, ending beautifully as the fast breaks with the moon's arrival."
