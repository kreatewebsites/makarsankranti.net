  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special day, honored on October 20, 2024.",
  "The moon, eagerly awaited on Karwa Chauth, tends to rise later in the evening. This isn't by chance but stems from a graceful cosmic rhythm influenced by its orbit, position, and Earth's location.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Just four days after the full moon, it rises later in the evening naturally.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth waning day, moonrise shifts much later than it did on the full moon night.",
  "Your exact latitude and longitude decide when the moon rises, causing times to vary between cities.",
  "Choose your city to view the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Sunday, October 20, 2024. You can also find the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the timings for Chaturthi Tithi for your ease.",
  "This diagram shows the moon's rise time delaying each night after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, occurs during a phase when the moon rises late.",
  "The moon's arrival is more than tradition; it symbolizes patience, love, sacrifice, and the deep devotion within a marital bond. This waiting period forms the emotional core of the festival, ending beautifully as the fast is broken under its light."
