  "The story revolves around a beautiful queen named Veeravati, the only sister to seven loving brothers. On her first Karwa Chauth, she observed a strict fast at her parents' home. By evening, she was desperately waiting for the moon to rise, feeling weak from thirst and hunger. Seeing their sister's distress, her brothers couldn't bear it. They created an illusion of a moon by placing a mirror in a pipal tree and holding a flame behind a sieve.",
  "Mistaking it for the real moon, Veeravati broke her fast. The moment she took a bite of food, news arrived that her husband, the king, was gravely ill. Heartbroken, she rushed to his side and, on the way, met Goddess Parvati who revealed her brothers' deception. The Goddess advised her to re-observe the fast with complete devotion. Veeravati did so, and due to her unwavering faith and prayers, Yama, the god of death, was forced to restore her husband to life. Since then, it became a tradition for women to look at the moon through a sieve, remembering Veeravati's story and praying for their husbands' long lives.",
