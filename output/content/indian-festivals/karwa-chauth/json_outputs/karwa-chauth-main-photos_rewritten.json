  "A hands-on guide to grasping the moon's schedule on this special day, honored on Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon's late rise on Karwa Chauth is no accident but part of a cosmic rhythm. Its timing aligns with its orbital path, position in the sky, and Earth's location.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it’s just four days after the full moon, moonrise happens later in the evening.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later each day. By the fourth day of its waning phase, this delay becomes noticeable, making moonrise much later than it was on the full moon night.",
  "Your exact position on Earth—latitude and longitude—dictates when the moon rises, causing times to vary by location.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Details on fasting hours (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi duration are included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each night after the full moon, with Karwa Chauth on the fourth day aligning with a naturally late moonrise.",
  "The moon's arrival transcends tradition, embodying patience, love, sacrifice, and the devotion woven into marital ties. This wait transforms into the festival's emotional core, culminating in the tender act of breaking the fast."
