  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special day, honored on Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon, long anticipated on Karwa Chauth, tends to grace the sky later in the evening. This phenomenon isn't random; it's a reflection of the moon's orbital path, its celestial positioning, and Earth's geographical perspective.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Just four days after the full moon, it naturally rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth waning day, its rise is much later compared to the full moon night.",
  "Your exact latitude and longitude dictate when the moon rises, causing moonrise times to vary between different locations.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Details on fasting hours (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi duration are included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows the moon rising later each evening after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on day four, aligns with a phase when the moon appears late.",
  "The moon's arrival signifies more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the unwavering devotion of marriage. This wait transforms into the festival's emotional core, ending gracefully as the fast concludes under its glow."
