  "Veeravati was the beloved only sister of seven brothers. On her first Karwa Chauth, she was at her parents' home and fasted strictly. By evening, she was faint with thirst and hunger. Seeing her distress, her brothers couldn't bear it. They created a false moon by holding a mirror behind a pipal tree and tricking her into believing the moon had risen. She broke her fast, and immediately, news arrived that her husband, the king, was gravely ill. On her way to him, she met Goddess Parvati, who revealed the deception. The Goddess advised her to re-observe the fast with absolute devotion. Veeravati did so, and Yama, the god of death, was forced to restore her husband to life. This story highlights the importance of observing the fast with unwavering faith.",

  "The most famous legend is that of Savitri. She was a princess of great virtue who chose to marry Satyavan, a humble woodcutter, even though the sage Narada had predicted he would die in one year. When the fateful day arrived, Savitri followed her husband into the forest. As predicted, Satyavan's life force began to wane. Yama, the God of Death, appeared to take his soul. But Savitri refused to let go. She followed Yama, and impressed by her devotion, intelligence, and unwavering love, Yama granted her several boonsâ€”everything except Satyavan's life. For her final boon, she cleverly asked to be blessed with children. As a virtuous wife, she could not have children without her husband, forcing Yama to restore Satyavan's life. This tale symbolizes a wife's power to protect her husband from all harm.",
