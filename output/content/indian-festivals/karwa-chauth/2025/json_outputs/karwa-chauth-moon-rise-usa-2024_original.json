  "An interactive guide to understanding the moon's timing on this auspicious day, celebrated on October 20, 2024.",
  "The eagerly awaited moon on Karwa Chauth often rises late in the evening. This isn't a coincidence but a result of a beautiful cosmic rhythm. The delay is due to the moon's natural orbital cycle, its position in the sky, and our location on Earth.",
  "Karwa Chauth falls on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the waning phase of the moon (Krishna Paksha). Being only four days past the full moon, its rise time is naturally later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises approximately 50 minutes later each day. By the fourth day of the waning cycle, this adds up, pushing the moonrise significantly later than on the night of the full moon.",
  "Your specific location on Earth—your latitude and longitude—determines the exact time the moon will appear over the horizon. This is why timings differ from city to city.",
  "Select your city to find the anticipated moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Sunday, October 20, 2024. The general fasting time (Puja Muhurat) and the duration of the fourth lunar day (Chaturthi Tithi) are also provided for your convenience.",
  "This chart illustrates how the moon's rise time shifts later each evening following the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, naturally falls at a point in the cycle where the moon appears late.",
  "The wait for the moon is more than just a ritual; it's a profound symbol of patience, love, sacrifice, and the deep dedication inherent in the marital bond. This period of anticipation becomes the emotional heart of the festival, beautifully culminating in the moment the fast is broken upon the moon's arrival."
