  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's timing on this special occasion, observed on Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon, eagerly awaited on Karwa Chauth, often graces the sky late in the evening. This isn't mere chance but a reflection of a cosmic rhythm, influenced by its orbit, position, and Earth's location.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it's just four days after the full moon, the moon rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later daily. By the fourth waning night, this delay becomes noticeable, shifting moonrise well past the full moon's timing.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—latitude and longitude—sets the precise moment the moon rises. This explains why times vary between locations.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. You'll also find details about the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the span of the Chaturthi Tithi for easy reference.",
  "This diagram shows the moon's rise time delaying nightly after the full moon, placing Karwa Chauth on the fourth day when the moon is naturally late.",
  "The moon's wait transcends ritual, embodying patience, love, sacrifice, and the devotion central to marital ties. This anticipation forms the festival's soul, ending beautifully as the fast breaks with the moon's rise."
