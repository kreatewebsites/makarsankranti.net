  "A hands-on guide to grasping the moon's schedule for this special day, marked on October 20, 2024.",
  "The moon, eagerly awaited on Karwa Chauth, tends to rise late in the evening. This isn’t mere chance but stems from a graceful cosmic rhythm, influenced by its orbit, position, and our earthly vantage point.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the Krishna Paksha, the moon's waning phase. Just days after the full moon, its rise happens later in the evening.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later daily, and by the fourth waning night, this delay makes moonrise much later than it was on the full moon.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—latitude and longitude—decides when the moon rises, causing city-to-city time differences.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Sunday, October 20, 2024. The fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the timings for Chaturthi Tithi are also listed for your reference.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each night after the full moon, aligning Karwa Chauth on the fourth day when the moon naturally appears late.",
  "The moon's arrival is more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the devotion woven into marital ties. This wait transforms into the festival's soul, ending beautifully as the fast concludes under its glow."
