  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon’s schedule on this special day, honored on Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The long-awaited moon on Karwa Chauth usually appears late in the evening, guided by a cosmic rhythm. This delay stems from the moon's orbital path, its position in the sky, and Earth's location.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it's just four days after the full moon, moonrise happens later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, so by day four of the waning phase, moonrise occurs much later than it did on the full moon night.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—defined by latitude and longitude—sets the precise moment the moon rises. This explains why times vary between locations.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi duration are also included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each evening after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, aligns with a phase where the moon emerges late.",
  "The moon's arrival transcends tradition, embodying patience, love, sacrifice, and the enduring devotion of marriage. This wait transforms into the festival's emotional core, climaxing as the fast ends under its glow."
