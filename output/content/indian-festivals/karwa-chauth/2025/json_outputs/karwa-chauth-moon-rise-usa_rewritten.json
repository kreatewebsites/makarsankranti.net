  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special day, honored Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon, eagerly awaited on Karwa Chauth, often appears late in the evening. This isn’t mere chance but stems from a cosmic rhythm—the moon’s orbit, its position, and our place on Earth all play a role.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it’s just four days after the full moon, moonrise happens later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily. By the fourth waning day, this delay becomes noticeable, making moonrise much later than on the full moon night.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—latitude and longitude—sets the precise moment the moon rises, causing times to vary by location.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the timing of Chaturthi Tithi are included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each evening after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, aligns with a phase where the moon emerges late.",
  "The moon's arrival is more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the devotion woven into marital ties. This wait transforms into the festival's emotional core, ending beautifully when the fast is broken under its glow."
