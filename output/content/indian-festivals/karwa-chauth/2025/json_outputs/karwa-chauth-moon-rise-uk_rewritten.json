  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon on Karwa Chauth often appears late, a result of its celestial rhythm. Its timing depends on the moon’s orbit, its position, and our place on Earth.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it’s just four days after the full moon, the moon rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, and by the fourth day of waning, this delay becomes noticeable, making moonrise much later than on the full moon night.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—latitude and longitude—sets when the moon rises, causing times to vary by location.",
  "Choose your city to view the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Information on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the timings of Chaturthi Tithi are included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each evening after the full moon, with Karwa Chauth on the fourth day aligning when the moon appears late.",
  "The moon's awaited rise transcends ritual, embodying patience, love, sacrifice, and the marital bond's deep devotion. This anticipation forms the festival's soul, ending beautifully as the fast concludes with the moon's appearance."
