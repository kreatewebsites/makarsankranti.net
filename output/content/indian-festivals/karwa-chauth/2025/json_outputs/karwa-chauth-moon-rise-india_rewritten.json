  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special day, honored on Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The long wait for the moon on Karwa Chauth arises from its natural orbital cycle. Its late evening rise aligns with cosmic rhythms, influenced by its position and our location on Earth.",
  "Karwa Chauth is observed on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it's just four days after the full moon, moonrise occurs later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth waning day, moonrise shifts noticeably compared to the full moon night.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—latitude and longitude—sets when the moon rises, which is why times vary between cities.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. You'll also find details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi duration for your ease.",
  "This chart shows the moon rising later each evening after the full moon. By the fourth day, during Karwa Chauth, the moon naturally appears late in its cycle.",
  "The moon's arrival transcends ritual, embodying patience, love, sacrifice, and the devotion of marriage. This waiting period forms the emotional core of the festival, ending beautifully when the fast concludes under its glow."
