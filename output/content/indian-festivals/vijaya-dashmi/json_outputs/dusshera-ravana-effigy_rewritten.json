  "Discover the art of crafting your own Ravana effigy, blending tradition, creativity, and eco-friendly practices.",
  "This design highlights timeless visuals: a majestic figure, ten unique heads, a grand mustache, and elaborate, vibrant royal attire crafted from colorful paper. It aims to portray the imposing and regal essence of the demon king.",
  "Craft your effigy with eco-friendly materials. Opt for a bamboo frame, stuff it with hay or dried leaves, and decorate using natural, non-toxic dyes. This honors the festival sustainably.",
  "Go beyond direct depiction. Incorporate abstract forms, bold colors, and geometric patterns to symbolize the ten heads (vices). This creative approach offers a fresh angle and suits a collaborative art project.",
  "Used clothing or colored paper for costumes, non-toxic paints (such as tempera or plant-based dyes), and markers.",
  "Build the core structure with bamboo or rolled newspaper, shaping a simple humanoid form (one torso, two arms, and two legs) and fastening the joints tightly with jute twine.",
  "Fill the frame with dry grass or crumpled newspaper for bulk, securing it with twine to shape a rounded torso, arms, and legs.",
  "Cut out ten cardboard heads, making one larger for the center. Paint fierce faces, bold mustaches, and crowns on them. Arrange and glue them in a fan shape on a cardboard base.",
  "Wrap the body with old fabric or vibrant paper to mimic Ravana's outfit. Use non-toxic paints and markers to design details like a dhoti, sash, and decorative ornaments.",
  "Securely attach the fan of heads to the top of the torso. Attach hands cut from cardboard to the arms. Your Ravana effigy is now ready!",
  "Avoid filling the effigy with firecrackers; they lead to noise and air pollution.",
  "Avoid plastic, thermocol, or synthetics that emit toxic fumes when burned.",
  "Perform the symbolic burning in a clear area, far from structures, vegetation, and anything flammable.",
  "Adult supervision is required at all times, particularly during the final burning ceremony."
