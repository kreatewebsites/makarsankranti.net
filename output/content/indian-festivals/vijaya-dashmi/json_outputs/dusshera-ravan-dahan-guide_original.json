Ravan Dahan, the burning of an effigy of the demon king Ravana, symbolizes the triumph of good over evil. This section explains the story's significance, setting the cultural context for the preparations that follow. It's a celebration of righteousness, courage, and the ultimate victory of truth.",
  "A successful Ravan Dahan requires careful planning, from budgeting to scheduling. This section provides interactive tools and a clear timeline to help you organize your team and resources effectively. Explore the budget breakdown and key project milestones to ensure your event comes together smoothly and on schedule.",
  "The heart of the celebration is the effigy itself. This section provides a step-by-step guide to constructing the effigy of Ravana. Use the tabs below to navigate through each phase of the build, from creating the sturdy bamboo frame to the final decorative touches. Each step includes key materials and expert tips for a spectacular result.",
  "The frame is the most critical part, providing structure and stability. Use strong, thick bamboo for the main torso and legs, and thinner pieces for arms and details. Lash all joints securely with rope or strong wire.",
  "Create a wide, stable base to prevent the effigy from tipping over, especially in windy conditions.",
  "Construct the torso first, then attach the legs, arms, and neck structure. Ensure everything is symmetrical.",
  "Once the frame is ready, it's time to give it shape and a surface to paint on. This is typically done with paper, cardboard, or cloth stretched over the frame.",
  "Use hay or straw to bulk out the chest and limbs before applying the paper layers. This gives the effigy a more three-dimensional shape.",
  "Apply multiple layers of paper using adhesive for strength. Allow each layer to dry completely.",
  "Ravana's ten heads are his defining feature. Each head can be crafted separately and then attached to the main structure. Pay attention to the facial expressions to make them look menacing.",
  "Create a main, larger head for the center and nine smaller, identical heads to arrange around it. A lightweight material like papier-mâché is ideal.",
  "Mold the faces, let them dry, then paint them with bright, bold colors. Don't forget the iconic mustache!",
  "The final step is to bring the effigy to life with paint and prepare it for the main event by carefully placing fireworks inside.",
  "Paint the body with traditional attire and ornaments. Use gold and black to highlight features.",
  "Carefully place fireworks inside the body and head cavities, ensuring they are secure. This should ONLY be done by experienced adults.",
  "Ravan Dahan involves fire and fireworks, making safety the absolute top priority. This section outlines essential safety protocols to ensure a hazard-free celebration for everyone involved. Following these guidelines is not optional—it is crucial for protecting the construction team, the audience, and the surrounding property.",
  "The culmination of weeks of hard work is a grand spectacle. This section provides a sample schedule for the day of Ravan Dahan, helping you coordinate the final hours leading up to the main event. Proper timing ensures that the procession, rituals, and the final burning create a memorable and impactful experience for the entire community.",
  "Transport the effigy to the event ground and secure it firmly.",
  "Perform any cultural programs or processions leading up to the main event. Double-check all safety measures.",
  "The moment everyone is waiting for. The effigy is set alight, symbolizing the destruction of evil. Ensure the crowd is at a safe distance.",
  "Once the fire is completely extinguished, ensure the area is cleaned up responsibly.",
  "Happy Dussehra! May this victory of good over evil bring you joy and prosperity."
