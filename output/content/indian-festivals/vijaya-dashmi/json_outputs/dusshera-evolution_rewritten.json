  "From royal origins to worldwide celebrations, explore the evolution of Dussehra traditions over the ages.",
  "Dussehra's roots trace back to Hindu scriptures, notably the Ramayana and Devi Mahatmya. Historically, it held royal and martial importance, with kings venerating their weapons and seeking blessings before post-monsoon campaigns. Events like Mysore Dasara, supported by the Vijayanagara rulers and Wodeyars, introduced grand processions and royal assemblies still observed today. Elsewhere, it aligned with harvest cycles, celebrating the divine feminine.",
  "Under the British Raj, public festivals underwent transformation. As royal support waned in certain regions, Dussehra emerged as a vibrant community celebration. Ramlila performances grew in popularity, fostering unity and preserving cultural identity amid colonial pressures. The rise of 'sarvajanik' (community-driven) festivals transferred the festivities' ownership from royalty to the populace, subtly promoting nationalist ideals.",
  "Post-1947, Dussehra became a symbol of Indiaâ€™s diverse cultural heritage. The government started endorsing regional festivities to nurture national pride and unity. Mysore Dasara was officially recognized as the state festival ('Nada Habba'). Televised Ramlila performances on Doordarshan connected households nationwide, fostering a collective cultural experience and cementing Dussehra as a prominent Indian festival.",
  "Over the years, Dussehra has evolved under the influence of modernization and globalization. Advanced technology now enhances Ramlilas and effigy burnings with dazzling light and sound displays. The festival has grown increasingly commercial, fueled by corporate sponsorships and a thriving festive economy. At the same time, concerns about environmental impact have sparked a shift toward eco-friendly effigies and sustainable practices. For Indians abroad, Dussehra serves as a bridge to their roots, fostering hybrid celebrations that merge Indian traditions with local cultures to keep the heritage alive for future generations."
