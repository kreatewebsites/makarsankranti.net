Foreign chroniclers, such as Domingo Paes, documented the elaborate 'Mahanavami' celebrations at Hampi. Key traditions like military parades, regal processions, and the veneration of the state sword and throne took root in this period, influencing later dynasties.",
  "Following the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Raja Wodeyar I of Mysore reinstated the tradition in Srirangapatna in 1610. Recognizing the festival's cultural and political importance, he formalized the ritual of ascending the throne and hosting a grand durbar, embedding Dasara as a key symbol of Mysore's sovereignty and heritage.",
  "The Dasara celebrations paused under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan's rule. After Tipu Sultan's death in 1799, the British restored the Wodeyar dynasty.
