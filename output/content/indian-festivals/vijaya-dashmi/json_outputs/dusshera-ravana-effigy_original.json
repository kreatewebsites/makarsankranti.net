  "Learn how to design and create your own Ravana effigy, embracing tradition with a touch of creativity and eco-consciousness.",
  "This design focuses on classic imagery: a towering figure, ten distinct heads, a grand mustache, and ornate, royal attire made from colorful paper. It's all about capturing the powerful and regal look of the demon king.",
  "Build your effigy using only biodegradable materials. Use a bamboo frame, hay or dried leaves for stuffing, and natural, non-toxic paints. This approach celebrates the festival while respecting the environment.",
  "Move beyond literal representation. Use geometric shapes, symbolic colors, and abstract forms to represent the ten heads (vices). This is a unique, artistic take that can be a great community art project.",
  "Old clothes or colored paper for attire, non-toxic paints (like tempera or natural dyes), and markers.",
  "Create the main frame using bamboo sticks or rolled newspapers. Construct a basic humanoid shape (a vertical torso piece, two for legs, two for arms) and tie the joints securely with jute twine.",
  "Wrap and stuff the frame with dry grass or crumpled newspaper to give it volume. Use twine to hold the stuffing in place, creating a rounded torso, arms, and legs.",
  "Draw and cut out ten heads from cardboard. Make one head larger for the center. Paint on fierce expressions, a prominent mustache, and a crown. Attach them in a fan shape to a cardboard base.",
  "Drape old clothes or colored paper around the body to create Ravana's attire. Paint the body and add details like a dhoti, a sash, and ornaments using your non-toxic paints and markers.",
  "Securely attach the fan of heads to the top of the torso. Attach hands cut from cardboard to the arms. Your Ravana effigy is now ready!",
  "Do not stuff the effigy with firecrackers. They cause noise and air pollution.",
  "Do not use any plastic, thermocol, or synthetic materials that release toxic fumes when burned.",
  "The symbolic burning should be done in an open space, away from buildings, trees, and flammable materials.",
  "This activity must always be supervised by adults, especially the final burning ritual."
