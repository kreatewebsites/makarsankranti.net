  "The tradition of celebrating Dasara with royal pomp and pageantry is believed to have started with the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century. Foreign travelers like Domingo Paes wrote vivid accounts of the grand \"Mahanavami\" festival at Hampi. The core elements of military parades, royal processions, and worship of the state sword and throne were established during this era, setting a precedent for future kingdoms.",
  "After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Raja Wodeyar I of Mysore revived the tradition in Srirangapatna in 1610. He understood the political and cultural significance of the festival in establishing sovereignty and continuity. He instituted the practice of ascending the royal throne and holding a special durbar (royal court), firmly rooting the Dasara celebrations in the identity of the Mysore Kingdom.",
  "The celebrations faced a brief hiatus during the reign of Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. However, following the death of Tipu Sultan in 1799, the British reinstated the Wodeyar dynasty. The newly crowned Krishnaraja Wodeyar III shifted the capital to Mysore and immediately worked to revive the Dasara festivities with renewed vigor, seeing it as a way to re-establish the cultural authority of his kingdom.",
  "Under Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, the Dasara Durbar became an elaborate affair. It was an occasion for the king to meet his subjects, receive tributes from feudatory chiefs, and display the military and cultural might of the state. The tradition of the grand procession on Vijayadashami day, which later evolved into the Jumboo Savari, gained prominence during his long reign, making Mysore the undisputed center of Dasara celebrations.",
  "After India's independence and the abolition of the princely states, the festival's future was uncertain. However, the Government of Karnataka took over the responsibility of conducting the festival, preserving its cultural essence while adapting it for a modern, democratic era. It was designated as the 'Nadahabba' or State Festival. While the royal family continues its private traditions, the public spectacle, including the grand procession, is now a state-sponsored event that celebrates the heritage of Karnataka.",
