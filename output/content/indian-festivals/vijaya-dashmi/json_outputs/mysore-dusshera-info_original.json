  "The tradition begins with the great Vijayanagara Empire, who celebrated the Mahanavami festival with immense grandeur, setting the stage for centuries to come.",
  "Following the decline of Vijayanagara, Raja Wodeyar I establishes the tradition in Srirangapatna, ensuring the festival's survival and linking it to the Mysore Kingdom.",
  "Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar III introduces the special Durbar (royal assembly) at Mysore Palace, making it the grand event it is famous for today.",
  "After the abolition of princely rule, the Government of Karnataka continues the tradition, designating Dasara as the 'Nadahabba' or State Festival for all people to celebrate.",
  "While the festival spans 10 days of cultural events, music, dance, and food, the experience for most visitors is defined by a few key, unmissable spectacles. The chart illustrates how central the iconic Palace Illumination and the Grand Procession are to the overall Dasara experience, forming the core of the public celebration.",
  "On the final day, Vijayadashami, the city witnesses a spectacular procession. This is the culmination of the 10-day festival, symbolizing the victory of good over evil.",
  "The lead elephant carries the Goddess Chamundeshwari in a 750kg golden throne.",
  "The festival usually falls in September or October. The final three days, especially Vijayadashami (the 10th day), are the most spectacular and also the most crowded.",
  "Watch the palace illumination (7-10 PM daily), find a spot early to see the Jumboo Savari, and explore the Dasara Exhibition for food and fun.",
  "Book accommodation and travel months in advance. For the procession, instead of crowding near the palace, find a less-congested spot along the 5km parade route."
