Early Indian societies carefully observed the sun's transition, marking the day it shifted from its southward (Dakshinayana) to northward (Uttarayan) journey as deeply meaningful. This cosmic shift signaled the end of bitter winters and the arrival of warmer, longer days vital for farming, establishing it as a perfect occasion for celebration.",
  "In Hindu tradition, this day holds deep meaning. It is said that Surya, the Sun God, visits his son Shani (Saturn), mending their bond and illuminating the realm of darkness. Another tale from the Mahabharata speaks of the great Bhishma Pitamaha, who, granted the power to choose his moment of passing, rested on a bed of arrows for weeks, awaiting Uttarayan to depart and achieve moksha (liberation).",
