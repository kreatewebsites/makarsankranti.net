  "In the heart of the Dandaka forest, within their peaceful hermitage at Panchavati, lived Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana. Their idyllic exile was about to be shattered by a cunning plot, a glittering illusion that would set in motion the epic conflict of the Ramayana. This is the story of Maricha, the golden deer.",
  "Enraged by the humiliation of his sister Surpanakha, the demon king Ravana devised a plan to abduct Sita. He commanded his uncle, the shapeshifting rakshasa Maricha, to assume the form of an irresistible golden deer to lure Rama and Lakshmana away from their hermitage.",
  "The Golden Deer with skin of molten gold and horns of sapphire.",
  "When the magical deer pranced near their hermitage, its beauty captivated Sita instantly. She pleaded with Rama to capture the creature for her, either as a pet for their hermitage or for its magnificent golden pelt. Though Lakshmana suspected a trick, Rama, unable to deny Sita's wish, agreed to pursue the deer, instructing Lakshmana to stay and protect her at all costs.",
  "Rama set off in pursuit, but the golden deer was no ordinary animal. It was a master of illusion, leading him deeper and deeper into the forest. Follow the steps of the frustrating chase.",
  "The deer would appear just within Rama's reach, glittering in a sunbeam, only to playfully leap away the moment he drew close, always keeping a tantalizing distance.",
  "Far from the hermitage, the chase reached its tragic conclusion. This section details the final moments that sealed Sita's fate, separating Maricha's final act from Ravana's terrible entrance.",
  "Frustrated, Rama realized he was being tricked. He fired a divine arrow, striking Maricha. As the demon fell, he reverted to his true form and, with his dying breath, cried out in a perfect imitation of Rama's voice: \"Oh, Sita! Oh, Lakshmana!\" The cry carried through the forest, a final, fatal piece of the deception.",
  "Hearing the cry, a panicked Sita begged Lakshmana to go to his brother's aid. Despite his warnings and his duty to protect her, Sita's harsh words compelled him to leave. He drew a protective line, the Lakshmana Rekha, around the cottage, warning her not to cross it. Seizing his chance, Ravana appeared as a wandering sage. He tricked Sita into crossing the line to offer him alms, then revealed his true form and abducted her, carrying her away to Lanka in his flying chariot, Pushpaka Vimana.",
  "An interactive retelling of the story that triggered the great war of the Ramayana."
