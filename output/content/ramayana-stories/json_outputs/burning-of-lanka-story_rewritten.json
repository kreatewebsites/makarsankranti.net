  "Hanuman's task was done: he had located Sita and conveyed Rama's message. Yet, the mighty son of the Wind God saw a chance for more. Leaving quietly felt wrong—he resolved to send a stronger warning, one that would shake Ravana and his realm to its core.",
  "To assess the enemy's power and declare his arrival, Hanuman wreaked havoc in the lush Ashok Vatika, tearing down trees and demolishing structures. Only the tree sheltering Sita was left untouched. This was a calculated move, daring Ravana to confront him with his mightiest warriors.",
  "Ravana's warriors approached to seize the \"playful monkey,\" but Hanuman vanquished them all, ending with the defeat of Ravana's son, Akshayakumara.",
  "Finally, Ravana dispatched his strongest son, Indrajit. Hanuman willingly let himself be seized, intending to confront the Demon King face-to-face.",
  "Indrajit, wielder of divine arms, invoked the Brahmastra. Honoring the sacred gift of Lord Brahma, Hanuman chose to be bound. Mistaking his restraint for defeat, the rakshasas hauled the great Vanara to Ravana's court.",
  "In the court, Hanuman announced himself as a messenger of Rama and demanded Sita's immediate return. Enraged by his audacity, Ravana ignored the counsel of his wise brother Vibhishana, who argued that an envoy cannot be killed. Instead, Ravana decreed a humiliating punishment: 'A monkey's pride is in its tail. Set it on fire!'",
  "Ravana's prideful choice sealed his city's fate. The rakshasas eagerly bound Hanuman's tail in oil-soaked cloth, unaware of the divine force they provoked.",
  "As the rakshasas fetched cloth, Hanuman enchanted his tail to grow longer and longer. Before long, every piece of fabric in Lanka was exhausted, yet his tail remained uncovered. This was their first glimpse of the divine power they faced.",
  "His task complete, Hanuman dashed to the shore, dousing the fire on his tail. He paused briefly to console Sita, promising Rama's forces were near. Then, scaling Mount Arishta, he soared back across the sea—a victorious hero, his mission exceeding all hopes."
