  "With his sons, brothers, and greatest warriors slain, Ravana was the last champion of Lanka. Consumed by a grief and rage that burned hotter than any fire, he performed sacred rituals to augment his power and ascended his divine chariot. The sky darkened as the ten-headed king of the rakshasas stormed onto the battlefield for his final, fateful confrontation with Rama.",
  "Seeing Rama fighting on foot against the chariot-borne Ravana, the king of the gods, Indra, intervened. The heavens themselves were invested in this battle between Dharma and Adharma.",
  "Indra sent his own celestial chariot, driven by his charioteer Matali. It was armed with divine weapons, drawn by immortal horses, and protected by a divine aura. Rama ascended, now meeting his foe as an equal king.",
  "The battle that ensued was unlike any the world had ever seen. The sky was filled with the clash of celestial weapons, and the earth trembled with their power. For days they fought, neither gaining a clear advantage.",
  "Rama's arrows shattered Ravana's banner and decapitated his charioteer. Ravana, in turn, unleashed weapons that created illusions and storms of fire. They matched each other blow for blow, their skill and power shaking the foundations of the cosmos.",
  "Armed with this knowledge, Rama invoked the most powerful weapon in existenceâ€”the Brahmastra, an arrow gifted to him by the sage Agastya. This was no ordinary weapon; it contained the primordial power of the creator, Lord Brahma.",
  "He chanted the sacred mantras, infusing the arrow with the power of the wind in its feathers, the sun and moon in its tip, and the weight of the cosmic mountains Meru and Mandara in its shaft. The arrow blazed with an energy that could destroy the universe itself.",
  "Rama drew his bowstring to his ear and released the Brahmastra. It flew across the battlefield with an unerring aim, pierced Ravana's chest, struck the vessel of nectar in his navel, and returned to Rama's quiver. The great king of Lanka, the conqueror of the three worlds, dropped his weapons and fell from his chariot, his life force extinguished. The war was over. The heavens rained down flowers, divine music filled the air, and a great calm descended upon the earth. Dharma had been restored.",
  "An interactive retelling of the final battle and the victory of Lord Rama."
