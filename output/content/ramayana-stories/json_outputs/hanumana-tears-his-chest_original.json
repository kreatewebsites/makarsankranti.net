  "After Rama's grand coronation, the royal assembly of Ayodhya was filled with joy and celebration. King Rama and Queen Sita began distributing precious gifts to their allies and devotees as tokens of their immense gratitude. Sugriva, Vibhishana, Angada, and all the other Vanara heroes were honored for their service. Finally, it was Hanuman's turn.",
  "Looking at Hanuman with tears of affection, Sita removed her own priceless pearl necklace, a gift from her father Janaka, and placed it around Hanuman's neck. The entire court applauded, recognizing this as the highest honor bestowed upon the greatest of devotees.",
  "The necklace was a treasure beyond measure, not just for its material worth, but for the immense love and grace with which it was given.",
  "Hanuman accepted the gift with a humble bow. But what he did next shocked and confused the entire assembly. His actions, born of the purest devotion, were misunderstood as disrespect.",
  "Hanuman took the necklace in his hands. He removed one of the pearls, held it close to his ear, and then put it in his mouth, biting down on it. A look of disappointment crossed his face.",
  "Hanuman's answer was not one of words alone. It was a demonstration of a spiritual truth so profound that it silenced the entire court and became the ultimate definition of devotion.",
  "\"To me,\" Hanuman explained calmly, \"any object in this universe is worthless if it does not contain the name of my Lord Rama. I was checking if the holy name 'Rama' was inscribed within these pearls. Since it is not, this necklace holds no value for me.\"",
  "A courtier scoffed, \"If Rama's name is so important, is it inscribed on your own body?\" With a gentle smile, Hanuman replied, \"He is not merely on my body; He is my very life-breath.\" In a swift, stunning motion, he dug his powerful fingernails into his own chest and tore it wide open. There, seated within his heart, the entire assembly saw a divine, glowing image of Lord Rama and Mother Sita.",
  "The court was left breathless and humbled, tears flowing from every eye. Rama, overcome with emotion, stepped down from his throne and embraced his perfect devotee, magically healing the wound. He blessed Hanuman, declaring that as long as the story of Rama is told on this earth, Hanuman's name would be revered, and his presence felt. Hanuman's act demonstrated that true value lies not in external treasures, but in the internal, unwavering presence of the divine."
