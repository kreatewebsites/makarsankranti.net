  "Following Rama's grand coronation, Ayodhya's royal court buzzed with jubilation. King Rama and Queen Sita graciously bestowed treasures upon their loyal allies as symbols of heartfelt thanks. Sugriva, Vibhishana, Angada, and the other Vanara warriors were lauded for their valor. At last, Hanuman was called forward.",
  "With tears of love, Sita took off her precious pearl necklace, a gift from her father Janaka, and gently placed it around Hanuman’s neck. The court erupted in applause, honoring the ultimate tribute to the noblest devotee.",
  "The necklace was priceless, not for its value alone, but for the boundless love and kindness it carried.",
  "Hanuman received the gift with a modest bow, but his next move stunned and baffled everyone present. What sprang from his deepest devotion was wrongly seen as an act of disrespect.",
  "Hanuman picked up the necklace, plucked a pearl, and brought it to his ear before biting into it. His face soon revealed a tinge of disappointment.",
  "Hanuman's reply transcended words, revealing a profound spiritual truth that stilled the court and epitomized true devotion.",
  "Hanuman calmly said, \"To me, any object in this universe lacks worth if it doesn’t bear the name of Lord Rama. I was only checking if these pearls carried the sacred name 'Rama.' Since they do not, this necklace means nothing to me.\"",
  "A courtier mocked, \"If Rama's name holds such power, is it etched on your body?\" Hanuman smiled softly and said, \"He is not just on me; He is my very essence.\" Without hesitation, he dug his strong nails into his chest, tearing it open. To everyone's amazement, within his heart shone a radiant vision of Lord Rama and Mother Sita, seated in divine splendor.",
  "The court fell silent, awash with emotion, as tears streamed from every eye. Rama, his heart full, descended from his throne and gently embraced his devoted Hanuman, miraculously mending the hurt. He blessed Hanuman, proclaiming that for as long as Rama’s tale is shared, Hanuman’s name would be cherished, and his spirit ever-present. Hanuman’s deed revealed that the greatest treasure lies not in worldly riches, but in the steadfast presence of the divine within."
