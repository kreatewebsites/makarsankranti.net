  "His primary mission was complete: he had found Sita and delivered Rama's message. But Hanuman, the wise and powerful son of the Wind God, knew that simply leaving would be a missed opportunity. He decided to deliver a second, more forceful messageâ€”one that would strike terror into the heart of Ravana and his kingdom.",
  "To gauge the enemy's strength and announce his presence, Hanuman began to destroy the beautiful Ashok Vatika, uprooting trees and smashing structures. He spared only the tree under which Sita sat. The act was a deliberate provocation, a challenge to Ravana to send out his best warriors.",
  "One by one, Ravana's warriors came to capture the \"mischievous monkey.\" One by one, Hanuman defeated them, culminating in the slaying of Ravana's own son, Akshayakumara.",
  "Finally, Ravana sent his mightiest son, Indrajit. Hanuman allowed himself to be captured, for his true aim was to stand before the Demon King himself.",
  "Indrajit, master of celestial weapons, unleashed the Brahmastra. Out of respect for the divine weapon given by Lord Brahma, Hanuman allowed it to bind him. The rakshasas, thinking him subdued, dragged the mighty Vanara to Ravana's court.",
  "In the court, Hanuman announced himself as a messenger of Rama and demanded Sita's immediate return. Enraged by his audacity, Ravana ignored the counsel of his wise brother Vibhishana, who argued that an envoy cannot be killed. Instead, Ravana decreed a humiliating punishment: \"A monkey's pride is in its tail. Set it on fire!\"",
  "Ravana's arrogant decision would become his city's doom. The rakshasas gleefully wrapped Hanuman's tail in oil-soaked cloths, underestimating the divine power they were playing with.",
  "As the rakshasas brought cloths, Hanuman magically began to extend his tail. It grew longer and longer, and soon, all the cloth in Lanka was used up, yet his tail was not fully covered. This was the first hint of the divine power they were dealing with.",
  "With his work done, Hanuman rushed to the ocean's shore and extinguished the flames on his tail. He took a moment to visit Sita one last time, reassuring her that Rama's army would arrive soon. Then, ascending Mount Arishta, he launched himself back across the ocean, a triumphant hero returning from a mission accomplished beyond all expectations."
