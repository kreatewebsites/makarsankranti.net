  "After Hanuman's devastating attack on Lanka, Ravana, for the first time, felt a flicker of fear. He convened his council of ministers and generals to decide the future course of action. While most of his court, blinded by arrogance, called for all-out war, one voice rose in oppositionâ€”the voice of his own younger brother, Vibhishana.",
  "Vibhishana, who was devoted to Dharma (righteousness), saw the clear path to ruin his brother was taking. He pleaded with Ravana to avert the coming catastrophe.",
  "\"Brother, what you have done is a great sin,\" Vibhishana argued. \"Abducting another's wife is against all codes of conduct. Rama is no mere mortal; a single one of his messengers burned our city. Imagine the power of his entire army! The path of righteousness is clear. Return Sita with honor, beg for forgiveness, and save our kingdom and our clan from annihilation.\"",
  "The other ministers, including Indrajit, mocked Vibhishana's words. \"What is there to fear from two human ascetics and a band of monkeys?\" they boasted. \"You are a coward, Vibhishana! Ravana is the conqueror of the three worlds. We should march out and crush them!\" Their pride-filled words resonated with Ravana's own arrogance.",
  "Ignoring his brother's wisdom, Ravana publicly humiliated Vibhishana. This final insult severed the bonds of kinship and forced Vibhishana to make a choice that would change the course of the war.",
  "Making one last attempt, Vibhishana fell at Ravana's feet. \"I speak not from fear, but from love for you and our family! Please, listen to reason before it is too late!\"",
  "Vibhishana and his four loyal ministers flew across the sky and landed in Rama's camp, seeking asylum. His arrival caused a stir, with most of the Vanara leaders suspecting a trick.",
  "\"Lord Rama, this is clearly a trap,\" argued Sugriva, the Vanara king. \"He is the enemy's brother, sent here to sow discord and learn our secrets. We cannot trust him. He must be imprisoned or killed.\" Most of the other leaders agreed with this cautious, strategic assessment.",
  "But Rama, the embodiment of Dharma, overruled them. \"My vow is to grant protection to anyone who seeks refuge in me, even if it were Ravana himself,\" he declared. \"Vibhishana has abandoned a sinful brother to join the side of righteousness. He comes not as a spy, but as a devotee. We will welcome him.\" With that, Rama not only accepted Vibhishana but also performed his ceremonial consecration as the future king of Lanka, sealing their alliance.",
