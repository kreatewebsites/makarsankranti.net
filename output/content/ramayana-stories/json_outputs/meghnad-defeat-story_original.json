  "With Kumbhakarna slain, Ravana's spirit was broken. But Lanka had one final, terrible champion: his son, Meghnad. So powerful was he that he had once defeated Indra, king of the gods, earning the name 'Indrajit'—Conqueror of Indra. A master of illusion and celestial weapons, he was the most formidable warrior Rama and Lakshmana had yet to face.",
  "Indrajit's greatest strength was his ability to turn invisible and attack from the clouds. Twice he had struck devastating blows, nearly annihilating the Vanara army and felling Rama and Lakshmana with the dreaded Nagapasha—a storm of arrows that turned into venomous serpents.",
  "Each time, only divine intervention—the arrival of Garuda, the divine eagle—could save the brothers. It became clear that Indrajit could not be defeated in a conventional fight.",
  "The key to defeating the invincible prince came from an unlikely source: Vibhishana, Ravana's righteous brother who had joined Rama's side.",
  "Vibhishana revealed that Indrajit drew his power from a secret sacrificial ritual, the Nikumbhila Yagna, performed in a hidden temple. If he completed the yagna, his chariot would become invincible, and he could not be killed by any man or god. The only way to defeat him was to attack while he was performing the ceremony.",
  "Knowing his nephew's defeat was essential for the cause of dharma, Vibhishana agreed to lead Lakshmana and a select group of warriors to the secret location of the ritual. It was a perilous mission, as they would have to face the enraged Indrajit at the source of his power, without the support of the main army.",
  "Under the cover of secrecy, Lakshmana, Hanuman, and Vibhishana stormed the hidden temple. The confrontation that followed was one of the most ferocious battles of the entire war.",
  "Lakshmana and his forces smashed the sacrificial implements, desecrating the yagna before it could be completed. Furious at the sacrilege and betrayal by his uncle, Indrajit abandoned the ritual and rose to fight, his invincibility now denied him.",
  "The death of Indrajit was the single greatest blow to Ravana's spirit. His mightiest son, the conqueror of heaven, was gone. The news shattered the morale of the rakshasa army and sent a wave of jubilation through the Vanara camp. The path to Ravana was now clear. Lanka's final hope had been extinguished.",
  "An interactive retelling of the climactic battle between Lakshmana and Indrajit."
