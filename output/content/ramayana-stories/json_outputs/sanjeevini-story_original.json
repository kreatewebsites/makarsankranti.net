  "During the ferocious battle with Indrajit, Lakshmana, while defending Rama, was struck by the prince's most powerful weapon, the Shakti. The divine missile pierced his chest, and he fell to the ground, unconscious and on the verge of death. A wave of despair washed over the Vanara army, and for the first time, Lord Rama wept with grief, his heart breaking at the sight of his beloved brother.",
  "The Vanara's royal physician, Sushena, examined Lakshmana and declared that there was only one hope. In the high Himalayas, on the Dronagiri mountain, grew four divine herbs. Of these, the Sanjeevani was the only one that could restore life. But it had to be brought before the next sunrise, or all would be lost.",
  "The mountain was hundreds of leagues away, an impossible distance to cover in a single night for anyone but one hero: Hanuman.",
  "Without a moment's hesitation, Hanuman bowed to Rama and took a mighty leap towards the north. But Ravana, learning of this mission from his spies, was determined to stop him.",
  "Expanding his form to the size of a mountain, Hanuman took flight, his mind focused solely on his lord's sorrow. He flew with the speed of thought, crossing the entire length of the land in his desperate mission.",
  "With time running out and no way to identify the correct herb, Hanuman faced a critical dilemma. His solution was an act of devotion and power so immense it became legendary.",
  "As he stood on the Dronagiri peak, he saw that the entire mountain was covered in thousands of glowing, magical herbs. In his haste, and with the herbs concealing their true forms, he could not distinguish the Sanjeevani from the others. He could not afford to make a mistake.",
  "\"If I cannot find the herb,\" he reasoned, \"I will simply bring the source.\" He once again expanded his body to a cosmic size, wrapped his powerful arms around the base of the mountain peak, and with a mighty heave, lifted the entire Dronagiri mountain into the air.",
  "Flying back with the mountain in one hand, Hanuman was a sight that awed the heavens. Just as the first rays of dawn were breaking, he arrived back at the battlefield. Sushena quickly found the Sanjeevani herb, crushed it, and administered it to Lakshmana. Instantly, Lakshmana's wounds healed, and he rose as if from a deep sleep, strong and whole once more. A roar of triumph and joy erupted from the Vanara army. Rama embraced Hanuman, his eyes filled with tears of gratitude, declaring his debt to his devoted servant to be eternal.",
