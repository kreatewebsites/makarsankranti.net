  "Meet the powerful antagonist in this section. Tap the card to uncover Ahiravan's abilities and goals.",
  "Ahiravan, a dark sorcerer and ardent follower of goddess Mahamaya, reigned over the underground Patala. Gifted with teleportation, illusions, and shapeshifting, he was called by Ravana to destroy Rama and Lakshmana—not through battle, but as sacrificial offerings in his shadowy temple to attain supreme power.",
  "Sensing danger, Hanuman wove his tail into a mighty fortress around Rama and Lakshmana's camp. Yet, Ahiravan's guile prevailed—disguising himself as Vibhishana, Ravana's virtuous sibling and Rama's trusted ally, he infiltrated the camp. With dark magic, he plunged the Vanara army into a deep sleep and seized the unconscious Rama and Lakshmana, whisking them to Patala for a ritual sacrifice at sunrise.",
  "After learning of the abduction, a heartbroken Hanuman vowed to save his lords. With Vibhishana's counsel, he set out on a daring journey to the underworld. Click each step to follow his adventure.",
  "Hanuman discovered the secret gateway to the underworld, a shadowy, forbidding tunnel. Shrinking to the size of a thumb, he dove into the depths, embarking on his perilous journey downward.",
  "Within Ahiravan's shrine, Hanuman discovered Rama and Lakshmana ready for sacrifice. To rescue them, he relied on his cunning and strength. This part recounts his smart trickery and the fierce clash that ensued.",
  "Ahiravan's life was tied to five lamps placed in different directions. Hanuman assumed his powerful Panchmukhi (five-faced) form—Hanuman, Hayagriva, Narasimha, Garuda, and Varaha. Each face blew out a lamp at once, destroying Ahiravan's immortality.",
  "Hanuman shattered Ahiravan's power and battled him fiercely. Taking his colossal form, he subdued the sorcerer king. Carrying Rama and Lakshmana on his shoulders, Hanuman soared back to the surface, reaching the Vanara camp at dawn, rescuing his lords from imminent peril."
