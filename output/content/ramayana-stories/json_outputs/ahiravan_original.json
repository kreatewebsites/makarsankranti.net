  "During the great war for Lanka, when Ravana's defeat seemed imminent, he called upon his secret weapon: his brother Ahiravan, the powerful and malevolent sorcerer king of Patala, the netherworld. This is the story of his dark plot and the unwavering devotion of Hanuman who journeyed into darkness itself to save his lords.",
  "This section introduces the formidable antagonist. Click the card to learn more about Ahiravan's powers and motivations.",
  "Ahiravan was a master of the dark arts and a fervent devotee of the goddess Mahamaya. He ruled the subterranean realm of Patala and could teleport, create illusions, and shapeshift. Summoned by Ravana, his mission was to eliminate Rama and Lakshmana not on the battlefield, but as a sacrifice in his dark temple to gain ultimate power.",
  "Aware of the threat, Hanuman created an impenetrable fortress with his tail around Rama and Lakshmana's camp. But Ahiravan was cunning. He took the form of Vibhishana, Ravana's righteous brother and Rama's ally, gaining entry to the camp. Using his powers, he cast a deep spell of slumber over the entire Vanara army and abducted the unconscious Rama and Lakshmana, spiriting them away to his kingdom in Patala to be sacrificed at dawn.",
  "Upon discovering the abduction, a grief-stricken Hanuman pledged to rescue his lords. Guided by Vibhishana, he embarked on a perilous journey to the underworld. Follow his path by clicking on each step of his quest.",
  "Hanuman located the hidden entrance to the underworld, a deep, dark tunnel. He shrank his form to the size of a thumb and plunged into the abyss, beginning his dangerous descent.",
  "Inside Ahiravan's temple, Hanuman found Rama and Lakshmana prepared for sacrifice. To save them, he used both his wit and his might. This section details his clever deception and the epic battle that followed.",
  "Ahiravan's life force was hidden in five lamps, placed in different directions. To extinguish them all at once, Hanuman revealed his mighty Panchmukhi (five-faced) form: Hanuman, Hayagriva, Narasimha, Garuda, and Varaha. Each face blew in a different direction, extinguishing the lamps simultaneously and breaking Ahiravan's immortality.",
  "With Ahiravan's power broken, Hanuman engaged him in a fierce battle. Resuming his giant form, Hanuman overpowered the sorcerer king. He then placed Rama and Lakshmana on his shoulders and flew back to the surface, returning to the Vanara camp just as the sun rose, having saved his lords from certain doom."
