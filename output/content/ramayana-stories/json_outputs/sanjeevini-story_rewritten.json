  "In the fierce clash against Indrajit, Lakshmana, protecting Rama, was hit by the prince's mighty Shakti weapon. The celestial missile pierced his chest, leaving him unconscious and near death. Despair gripped the Vanara army, and for the first time, Lord Rama shed tears of anguish, his soul shattered at the sight of his cherished brother.",
  "The Vanara physician Sushena inspected Lakshmana and proclaimed just one chance: atop Dronagiri in the Himalayas grew four sacred herbs. Among them, the Sanjeevani alone could revive life. Yet, it must arrive before dawn, or all hope would fade.",
  "The mountain lay hundreds of leagues distant, a journey impossible overnight for all but one hero: Hanuman.",
  "Without delay, Hanuman bowed to Rama and leaped northward with great force. However, Ravana, alerted by his spies, vowed to thwart his mission.",
  "Hanuman grew to the size of a mountain and leaped into the skies, his heart set on easing his lord's pain. With the swiftness of thought, he soared across the vast land, driven by his urgent task.",
  "Time was slipping away, and without a way to find the right herb, Hanuman faced a dire choice. His response was an act of faith and strength so great it became timeless.",
  "Perched atop the Dronagiri peak, he gazed at the mountain blanketed in countless luminous, enchanted herbs. Rushing against time, and with the plants masking their identities, he struggled to spot the Sanjeevani among them. A single error could cost him dearly.",
  "'If the herb eludes me,' he thought, 'I shall carry its origin instead.' Swelling to an immense size, he stretched his colossal arms around the mountain's base and, with an earth-shaking effort, hoisted the towering Dronagiri high into the heavens.",
  "Soaring through the skies with the mountain in his grasp, Hanuman was a marvel that left even the gods in awe. As dawn's first light touched the earth, he returned to the battlefield, where Sushena swiftly identified the Sanjeevani herb. Crushing it with care, he applied it to Lakshmana, whose injuries vanished in moments. Revived and renewed, Lakshmana stood, his strength fully restored. The Vanara army erupted in cheers of victory and relief. Rama, overcome with emotion, embraced Hanuman, vowing that his gratitude to his loyal devotee would last forever.",
  "A dynamic retelling of Hanuman's epic journey to rescue Lakshmana."
