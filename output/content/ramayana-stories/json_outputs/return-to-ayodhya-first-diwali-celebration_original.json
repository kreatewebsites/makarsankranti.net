  "With Ravana defeated and Dharma restored, Vibhishana was crowned the new king of Lanka. The purpose of the incarnation was fulfilled, and the fourteen-year period of exile, ordained by fate and honor, was finally at its end. It was time for the rightful king, his devoted wife, and his loyal brother to return to their beloved kingdom of Ayodhya.",
  "Vibhishana offered Rama the magical flying chariot of Ravana, the Pushpaka Vimana, for the journey. As they flew northwards, Rama pointed out to Sita the significant places of their long and arduous journey, turning the return trip into a poignant recollection of their trials and triumphs.",
  "The celestial chariot moved at the speed of thought, carrying Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and their loyal Vanara allies like Hanuman and Sugriva back towards their home.",
  "Hanuman flew ahead to inform Bharata of Rama's impending arrival. Overjoyed, Bharata commanded the entire city to prepare for the grandest welcome in history. The city was cleaned, decorated with flowers and banners, and as night fell, the people of Ayodhya lit millions of earthen lamps (diyas) to illuminate the path for their returning king and banish the darkness of the long separation.",
  "As the Pushpaka Vimana descended, the people of Ayodhya erupted in joyous celebration. Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana, having shed their ascetic robes for royal attire, were greeted with flowers, music, and tears of happiness. The entire city rejoiced at the sight of their beloved prince, now a victorious king.",
  "Rama's coronation marked the beginning of Ram Rajya, a golden age of peace, prosperity, and perfect justice that lasted for thousands of years. The celebration of his return, marked by the lighting of lamps, became an annual tradition.",
  "This very celebration is commemorated to this day as Diwali, the Festival of Lights. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignoranceâ€”a timeless reminder of the principles for which Lord Rama stood.",
  "An interactive retelling of the joyous return that became the foundation of Diwali."
