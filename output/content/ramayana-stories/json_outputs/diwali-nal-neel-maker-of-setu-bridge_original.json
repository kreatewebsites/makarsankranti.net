  "In the epic Ramayana, when Lord Rama faced the impossible task of crossing the ocean to Lanka, two brilliant engineers from the Vanara army, Nal and Neel, rose to the occasion. They masterminded the construction of a legendary bridge, a feat of devotion, engineering, and divine power that endures in scripture and satellite imagery to this day.",
  "Sita, Lord Rama's wife, had been abducted by the demon king Ravana and was held captive in Lanka. Rama's army of Vanaras stood at the southern shore of the Indian subcontinent, faced with the vast, tumultuous ocean. The challenge was monumental: how to transport an entire army across the sea to wage war and rescue Sita.",
  "This section introduces the two main architects behind this divine project. Both were sons of Vishwakarma, the celestial architect, inheriting his skills. Click on each profile to learn about their unique abilities and crucial roles in this epic undertaking.",
  "Nal was the primary engineer for the project. As the son of Vishwakarma, he possessed innate knowledge of construction and architecture. Crucially, he had received a boon in his childhood: any object he threw into the water would not sink, but float. This divine gift was the key to making the seemingly impossible bridge a reality.",
  "Neel, also a son of Vishwakarma, was a commander in Sugriva's army and an exceptionally skilled engineer. While Nal directed the core architecture using his boon, Neel managed the logistics, organized the massive Vanara workforce, and ensured the rapid and efficient supply of materials. His leadership was vital to completing the bridge in record time.",
  "The construction of the Ram Setu was a marvel of project management and divine engineering, completed in just five days. This section breaks down the project's key statistics and provides an interactive timeline of the construction. Explore each day to see how this colossal task was accomplished.",
  "The Vanara army, under Neel's command, began gathering massive rocks and trees. Led by Nal, the first day saw the construction of 14 yojanas of the bridge as the Vanaras worked tirelessly, inspired by their devotion to Lord Rama.",
  "The Ram Setu is more than just a bridge; it's a timeless symbol of faith and ingenuity. Its story intertwines divine power with incredible engineering. This section lets you explore two perspectives: the ancient legend of the floating stones and the modern scientific and satellite observations of this structure.",
  "The core of the legend is Nal's divine boon. It's believed the rocks and mountains, inscribed with Lord Rama's name, would become weightless when placed by Nal in the ocean, allowing them to float and form a stable, strong structure. Even the smallest creatures, like a squirrel, contributed, showing that devotion, not size, was what mattered. This act symbolizes that with faith and dedication, any obstacle can be overcome.",
  "Satellite images from agencies like NASA show a chain of limestone shoals between Rameswaram, India, and Mannar Island, Sri Lanka, which corresponds to the location of Ram Setu. Some scientific theories suggest these could be pumice stones, which are volcanic rocks filled with air pockets that can float. Others propose it is a natural formation of shoals. The structure remains a topic of active research and debate, connecting ancient text to modern scientific inquiry.",
