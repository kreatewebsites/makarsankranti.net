  "With Ravana vanquished and Dharma upheld, Vibhishana ascended as Lanka's new ruler. The divine mission was complete, and the fourteen-year exile, decreed by destiny and duty, had reached its conclusion. The rightful king, his faithful wife, and his steadfast brother now prepared to journey back to their cherished Ayodhya.",
  "Vibhishana presented Rama with Ravana's enchanted flying chariot, the Pushpaka Vimana, for their voyage. As they soared north, Rama showed Sita the key landmarks of their challenging journey, transforming the return into a heartfelt reflection on their struggles and victories.",
  "The divine chariot soared with the swiftness of thought, bearing Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and their steadfast Vanara companions, Hanuman and Sugriva, on their journey homeward.",
  "Hanuman soared ahead to deliver the news of Rama’s return to Bharata. Ecstatic, Bharata ordered the city to arrange a magnificent welcome. Streets were swept clean, adorned with flowers and vibrant banners, and as night descended, the citizens of Ayodhya lit countless earthen lamps (diyas), casting a brilliant glow to guide their king home and dispel the gloom of their years apart.",
  "As the Pushpaka Vimana landed, Ayodhya's streets burst into jubilant festivity. Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana, now adorned in regal garments, were welcomed with garlands, melodies, and heartfelt tears of joy. The city celebrated their cherished prince, now a triumphant ruler.",
  "Rama's coronation ushered in Ram Rajya, an era of harmony, wealth, and fairness that endured for millennia. His return was celebrated yearly with the glowing tradition of lamp lighting.",
  "This celebration endures as Diwali, the Festival of Lights, marking the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil, and wisdom over ignorance—a lasting tribute to the values upheld by Lord Rama.",
  "A lively retelling of the happy homecoming that inspires the spirit of Diwali."
