    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This page is designed to be the joyous climax of the entire saga, structured as a triumphant homecoming. 1) The Exile Ends sets the context, marking the completion of the 14-year term. 2) The Journey Home describes the celestial flight in the Pushpaka Vimana, using tabs to highlight key locations and reflections on their journey. 3) Ayodhya Awaits focuses on Bharata's unwavering devotion and the city's eager preparations. 4) The Festival of Lights is the core interactive section, using a step-based diagram to narrate the key events: The Arrival, The Reunion, and The Coronation. 5) The Dawn of Ram Rajya provides a powerful conclusion, explaining the significance of the event as the first Diwali. This structure builds a powerful sense of emotional release, celebration, and ultimate triumph. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: The flight in the Pushpaka Vimana -> Goal: Show the return journey -> Viz/Method: Tabbed content -> Interaction: Tabs for Kishkindha, The Great Bridge, and Panchavati -> Justification: This transforms a simple travel narrative into an interactive recap of their journey, allowing users to emotionally re-trace their steps. | Report Info: The sequence of homecoming events -> Goal: Detail the celebration -> Viz/Method: Interactive step-based diagram -> Interaction: Click steps for Arrival, Reunion, and Coronation -> Justification: This breaks down the highly emotional and ceremonial return into a clear, celebratory, and easy-to-follow sequence, giving each moment its due importance. | Report Info: Bharata's devotion -> Goal: Highlight a key character's role -> Viz/Method: Simple interactive card -> Justification: Focuses attention on the powerful emotional subplot of Bharata's 14-year wait and righteous regency. -->
