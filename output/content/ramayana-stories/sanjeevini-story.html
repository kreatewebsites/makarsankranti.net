    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This page narrates a desperate race against time and is structured to build tension and highlight Hanuman's power. 1) A Mortal Wound establishes the dire crisis with Lakshmana's fall. 2) The Only Cure introduces the near-impossible solution, creating a ticking clock. 3) The Race Against Time is the core interactive section, detailing Hanuman's perilous journey and the obstacles he overcomes. 4) A Mountain in Hand focuses on the story's climax, using tabs to explain his dilemma and the audacious solution. 5) The Hero's Return provides the triumphant resolution. This chronological structure effectively conveys the urgency and immense scale of Hanuman's feat. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: The journey and its obstacles -> Goal: Show a perilous sequence -> Viz/Method: Interactive step-based diagram -> Interaction: Click steps for The Vow, The Deception, and The Confusion -> Justification: This breaks the long journey into key narrative challenges, building suspense before the final act. | Report Info: Hanuman's decision-making on the mountain -> Goal: Explain a critical choice -> Viz/Method: Tabbed content -> Interaction: Tabs for "The Dilemma" (can't find the herb) and "The Divine Solution" (lift the mountain) -> Justification: This isolates the pivotal moment of the story, clearly presenting the problem and Hanuman's incredible, out-of-the-box solution, thereby emphasizing his power and devotion. -->

                In the fierce clash against Indrajit, Lakshmana, protecting Rama, was hit by the prince's mighty Shakti weapon. The celestial missile pierced his chest, leaving him unconscious and near death. Despair gripped the Vanara army, and for the first time, Lord Rama shed tears of anguish, his soul shattered at the sight of his cherished brother.

                Soaring through the skies with the mountain in his grasp, Hanuman was a marvel that left even the gods in awe. As dawn's first light touched the earth, he returned to the battlefield, where Sushena swiftly identified the Sanjeevani herb. Crushing it with care, he applied it to Lakshmana, whose injuries vanished in moments. Revived and renewed, Lakshmana stood, his strength fully restored. The Vanara army erupted in cheers of victory and relief. Rama, overcome with emotion, embraced Hanuman, vowing that his gratitude to his loyal devotee would last forever.
