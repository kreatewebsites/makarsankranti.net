    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This page narrates a tale of dramatic irony and is structured to build from a grand royal ceremony to a shocking, personal confrontation. 1) The Imperial Sacrifice sets the stage with Rama's Ashwamedha Yajna. 2) The Wandering Horse explains the ritual's challenge. 3) The Unknowing Heirs introduces the young princes in their forest hermitage. 4) The Challenge Accepted is the core interactive section, using a step-by-step diagram to detail the twins' innocent capture of the horse and their astonishing defeat of Shatrughna's army. 5) A Kingdom in Disbelief uses tabs to show the aftermath: Shatrughna's humiliating report and Rama's decision to face the unknown warriors himself. This structure builds suspense and highlights the incredible, unrecognized power of the young princes. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: The capture of the horse and the ensuing battle -> Goal: Show a surprising sequence of events -> Viz/Method: Interactive step-based diagram -> Interaction: Click steps for The Capture, The Warning, and The Unbelievable Victory -> Justification: This method effectively breaks down the shocking confrontation, allowing the user to experience the army's disbelief as two children defeat them. | Report Info: The aftermath and report to Ayodhya -> Goal: Show the consequences and build anticipation -> Viz/Method: Tabbed content -> Interaction: Tabs for "A General's Shame" and "A King's Resolve" -> Justification: This separates the immediate result of the battle from the larger implication, effectively setting the stage for the final reunion of the Ramayana epic. -->

                Years after his coronation, King Rama sought to affirm his supreme rule and atone for the sins of war through the Ashwamedha Yajna, the grand horse sacrifice. A splendid white steed was sanctified and released to roam for a year, bearing a golden inscription proclaiming Rama's dominion. His brave youngest brother, Shatrughna, was entrusted with commanding the royal forces to safeguard the horse.
