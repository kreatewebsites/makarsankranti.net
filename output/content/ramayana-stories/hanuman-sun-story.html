    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This page tells a charming childhood incident and is structured to highlight the innocence and immense power of young Hanuman. 1) A Divine Birth introduces his parentage and the source of his power. 2) The Forbidden Fruit is the core narrative, presented as an interactive step-by-step journey showing his innocent mistake and cosmic leap. 3) A God's Intervention details the consequences, using tabs to separate Indra's angry reaction from the subsequent blessings bestowed by all the gods. 4) A Power Curtailed provides the resolution to the story, explaining the childhood curse that made him forget his powers. This structure presents the tale as a complete and compelling character origin story. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Hanuman's leap toward the sun -> Goal: Show a sequence of events -> Viz/Method: Interactive step-based diagram -> Interaction: Click steps for The Mistake, The Leap, and The Pursuit -> Justification: Breaks down a fantastical event into a simple, charming, and easy-to-follow narrative for the user. | Report Info: The gods' reaction (Indra's anger vs. the boons) -> Goal: Compare/Contrast divine responses -> Viz/Method: Tabbed content -> Interaction: Tabs for "Indra's Wrath" and "The Shower of Boons" -> Justification: This effectively contrasts the immediate, harsh reaction with the ultimate, benevolent outcome, showcasing the divine importance of the child Hanuman. -->

                Before becoming a mighty hero, Hanuman was a divine child named Maruti, born to Vanara queen Anjana and King Kesari. Gifted by Vayu, the Wind God, he possessed incredible strength, speed, and an uncontainable mischievous streak. This is the tale of his first great adventure.

                Now eternal and stronger than ever, young Hanuman kept up his antics. To shield both the world and him from his pure yet chaotic strength, sages cast a gentle curse: he would lose memory of his full potential. Living as an ordinary Vanara with his divine gifts hidden, he would only rediscover them when a noble being awakened his true essence for a momentous purpose.
