    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This narrative focuses on a single, epic character arc and is structured chronologically to build suspense and awe. 1) A Desperate Summons sets the dire stage for Ravana. 2) The Great Awakening is a unique, interactive section detailing the absurdly difficult task of waking the giant. 3) A Brother's Counsel highlights Kumbhakarna's wisdom and internal conflict before he goes to battle. 4) The Battle begins, presented as a step-by-step interactive narrative of his rampage and eventual defeat. 5) The Giant's Fall provides a tragic but honorable conclusion. This structure effectively portrays Kumbhakarna not just as a monster, but as a complex, duty-bound warrior. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: The process of waking Kumbhakarna -> Goal: Show Scale/Process -> Viz/Method: Interactive step-based diagram -> Interaction: Click steps (Drums, Elephants, Feasting) to see the escalating efforts -> Justification: This emphasizes the sheer magnitude of Kumbhakarna's slumber and makes it a memorable, engaging part of the story. | Report Info: Kumbhakarna's confrontation with Ravana -> Goal: Show Character Depth/Conflict -> Viz/Method: Tabbed content -> Interaction: Tabs for "A Fool's Errand" (his criticism) and "A Brother's Vow" (his loyalty) -> Justification: This effectively showcases his internal conflict between wisdom and duty, making him a more compelling character. | Report Info: The battle sequence -> Goal: Detail a large-scale conflict -> Viz/Method: Step-based diagram -> Interaction: Follow the steps from his initial destructive charge to his final confrontation with Rama -> Justification: Breaks down a chaotic battle into a clear, climactic, and easy-to-follow narrative. -->

                With his mighty generals, sons, and champions vanquished by Rama's forces, a desperate Ravana turned to his final hope: his towering younger brother, Kumbhakarna. Doomed by Brahma's curse to slumber for six months and awaken for only one day, the giant was Lanka's ultimate weapon—a living juggernaut capable of shifting the war's balance alone.

                Stripped of his weapon yet unyielding, the giant surged ahead, jaws agape to consume all before him. In a climactic moment, Rama loosed a celestial arrow that cleaved the giant's head from his body. The aftermath was cataclysmic—his massive form plunged into the ocean, sending waves surging skyward, while his severed head smashed into Lanka, toppling structures in its wake. A mighty spirit, tethered to a dark purpose, was at last set free.
