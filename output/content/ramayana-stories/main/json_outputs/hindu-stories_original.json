  "The most famous Diwali legend celebrates the return of Lord Rama, his wife Sita, and his brother Lakshmana to their kingdom of Ayodhya after 14 years of exile and defeating the demon king Ravana. The citizens of Ayodhya lit rows of clay lamps (diyas) to illuminate their path and welcome them home, symbolizing the victory of light over darkness and good over evil.",
  "In many parts of India, Diwali is celebrated a day before as Naraka Chaturdashi. This day commemorates Lord Krishna's victory over the demon king Narakasura, who had imprisoned 16,000 princesses. Krishna, with his wife Satyabhama, defeated the demon and freed the women, bringing an end to his reign of terror and restoring light to the world.",
  "Diwali is also the day when Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, is believed to have emerged from the cosmic ocean of milk during the Samudra Manthan (the Great Churning of the Ocean). Devotees worship her on Diwali night, lighting lamps to welcome her into their homes and seek her blessings for a prosperous year ahead.",
  "Another story connects Diwali to King Bali, a benevolent demon king. Lord Vishnu, in his fifth incarnation as the dwarf Vamana, visited Bali and asked for three paces of land. When Bali agreed, Vamana grew to a cosmic size, covering the heavens and earth in two steps. For the third step, the humble Bali offered his own head, and Vishnu pushed him to the netherworld, granting him immortality and the right to visit his kingdom once a year.",
  "According to the epic Mahabharata, Diwali also marks the day the five Pandava brothers returned to their kingdom of Hastinapura after 13 years of exile following their defeat in a game of dice against their cousins, the Kauravas. The citizens celebrated their return with great joy, lighting lamps throughout the city."
