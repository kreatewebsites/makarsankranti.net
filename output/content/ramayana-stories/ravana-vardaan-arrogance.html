    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This page explores Ravana's origin and is structured to show his progression from a determined ascetic to an arrogant tyrant. 1) A Scholar's Ambition introduces his noble lineage and his burning desire for power. 2) The Great Penance is an interactive section detailing his incredible austerities for Brahma, building a sense of awe at his determination. 3) The Fatal Boon explains the specific boon he received and the crucial, arrogant omission. 4) Devotion to Shiva uses tabs to show the duality of his relationship with another godâ€”one of both arrogance (lifting Kailash) and profound devotion (Tandava Stotram). 5) The Age of Arrogance concludes by showing how these boons directly led to his reign of terror, thus setting the stage for the entire Ramayana. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: The stages of Ravana's penance -> Goal: Show escalating determination -> Viz/Method: Interactive step-based diagram -> Interaction: Click steps for The Austerities, The Sacrifice, and The Reward -> Justification: This breaks down a multi-millennia penance into a digestible, impressive sequence for the user. | Report Info: Ravana's complex relationship with Shiva -> Goal: Show character complexity -> Viz/Method: Tabbed content -> Interaction: Tabs for "An Act of Hubris" and "A Hymn of Devotion" -> Justification: This effectively contrasts his arrogance with his capacity for genuine devotion, making him a more nuanced and compelling character than a simple villain. -->

                Before becoming the dreaded demon king, Ravana was Dashanana, a gifted scholar and Pulastya's illustrious grandson. Envious of his half-brother Kubera's wealth and influence, an intense ambition ignited within him. Determined, he vowed to undertake severe penances to attain unmatched power and surpass all others.

                Blessed with near-invincibility and celestial weapons, Ravana's ambition spiraled into oppression. He seized control of the three realmsâ€”heaven, earth, and the underworld. He vanquished the gods, subdued rulers, and claimed Kubera's golden Lanka along with his flying chariot. His ten heads symbolized not only vast wisdom but also his boundless pride and hunger for dominance.
